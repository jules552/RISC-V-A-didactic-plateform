The mux is a small module that is used to select between the two inputs that it has. It is used 2 times in this module, for selecting between
$rs1$ and $PC$ and for selecting between $rs2$ and $imm$. Sorry, I haven't used the standard shape of a MUX but I haven't found one on the 
website I'm using to draw the different diagrams. \\

Signals:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbullet}]
    \item Input: $a$, This signal is representing the first input of the mux.
    \item Input: $b$, This signal is representing the second input of the mux.
    \item Input: $sel$, This signal is representing the select signal of the mux.
    \item Output: $out$, This signal is representing the output of the mux.
\end{enumerate}
