\subsection{Parameters}
All the different parameters/constants used in the design of the processor are accessible in the file \texttt{parameters.vh} 
contained in the \texttt{verilog} folder inside the project.
I would have loved to not use such technic and instead do enums but Verilog doesn't support them and from what I've seen
from other projects, it's one of the most common ways to do it. \\
