\subsection{Verilog}
Not knowing anything about Verilog since at EPFL we used VHDL instead, I had to learn it from scratch.
For that, I've used a website given by the professor~\cite{verilog_tutorial} that explains the basics of Verilog and how to use it.
From here I've started creating small modules and searching for examples on the internet to see how other people were doing it
and also when needed I've used different forums to find answers to my questions and when needed consulted the official 
Verilog documentation~\cite{verilog_doc}.
