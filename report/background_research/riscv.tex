\subsection{RISC-V}
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the reduced instruction set
computer (RISC) principles. It is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation
through open standard collaboration.

Most of the research I've done on it to understand how it works and how to implement it has been
done on the official website of the RISC-V foundation~\cite[p.~9-25]{riscv_manual} and of course more precisely
the chapter about the RV32I base integer instruction set. Inside it describes how the different instructions
are encoded with the 6 different formats~\cite[p.~104-105]{riscv_manual} that are used to encode the different instructions but also 
how the different instructions should behave using a mix of the manual but also a reference card~\cite[p.~81-83]{refcard}.
