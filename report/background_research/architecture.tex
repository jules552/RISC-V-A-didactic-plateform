\subsection{Architecture}
\subsubsection{Unpipeline}
The unpipelined version of the CPU is mostly inspired by the one we did during the Comparch 1-2
courses at EPFL since NiosII and RISC-V are very similar. The main difference is that the RISC-V
is a 32 bits architecture while NiosII is a 16 bits architecture and also that RISC-V has a lot more
instructions than NiosII with small differences in how they work. 

\subsubsection{Pipeline}
The pipelined version is inspired also mostly by what we did during the Comparch 2 course at EPFL but
since we didn't implement the branch predictor and the forwarding paths, I had to imagine and think about 
most of the implementation myself. I've only done a couple of research to see if I could find some examples of 
such implementation mostly about forwarding paths since I wasn't sure how to implement it correctly at first 
glance. I've used mainly this pdf~\cite{forwarding_paths} to reassure myself that I was doing it correctly.
The branch predictor part has an algorithm I haven't invented called a two-level adaptive branch predictor~\cite{two_level_adaptive}.
It uses a 2 bits saturating counter but also knows patterns such that the predictions apply locally to the 
branch. It is a very simple algorithm but it works well enough for this project.
