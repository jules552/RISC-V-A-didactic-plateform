\subsection{Simulation Tools}
During the project, I mainly used a close source simulator that we were using at EPFL and 
developed by Intel called Questa Modelsim. It is a great tool combining compiling and seeing 
the waveforms of the signals in the same window. It is also very easy to use and has a lot of
features that I haven't used during the project. The only downside is that it is not free and
it is quite buggy sometimes and you need to activate an option called \texttt{full visibilty}
to have access to all the signals in the waveform window. At the end of the project, since I had 
to implement the CI, I needed a free simulator with a command line interface and I've used
Icarus Verilog. It is a free simulator that is not too hard to use and has a command-line interface.
The only downsides I've found while using it are that there is not a lot of documentation~\cite{icarus_tutorial} 
and it is a bit less user-friendly than Questa Modelsim. You have to use a different tool to see the waveforms
like GTKWave and you don't have access to the array of signals easily like in Questa Modelsim.
Also, one weird issue I've encountered is that the simulation gives different results than Questa Modelsim
because the full visibility option does things differently than Icarus Verilog, but I've luckily
found the issue even though to this day I don't know why it was doing that.
