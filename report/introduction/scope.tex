\subsection{Project Scope}
Here are the different main focus points of the project:


\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbullet}]
    \item Openess: It is an important point for the project to use as much as possible
    open source software and also for the project to be as open as possible such that people 
    can work on it with the less possible restrictions.
    \item Comprehensive: Since the project needs to be open source and be used by academic people
    to understand but also add things on top of it, the project needs to focus on being as comprehensive 
    as possible.
    \item Simplicity: This point is linked a bit with the last one, but the project doesn't aim as 
    performance first, but more as ease of understanding, so if a solution can be easier but degrade 
    a bit the performance, it should be taken except if it adds an educational value to do it
\end{enumerate}
