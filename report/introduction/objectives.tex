\subsection{Project Objectives}

Overall, the project aims to give a very basic implementation of an RV32IM processor such 
that it can be used as an academic tool to teach and explain how a RISC processor works 
and how to build one using HDL languages such as Verilog. Here are the main objectives that 
has been set for the project:

\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbullet}]
    \item First create an unpipelined version of the RV32IM processor as a proof of concept
    \item Pipeline the existing unpipelined version of the processor
    \item Fix the different issues caused by the pipelining of the processor, mainly the 
    data dependency but also the branch prediction problem by either stall or implementing some 
    forwarding paths and branch predictor and mechanisms to make everything work correctly
    \item The simulation should works on Icarus Verilog to make the whole process more open instead 
    of relying on proprietary software such as Questa Modelsim.
    \item Add extensive testing of the different main modules to make the processor as reliable 
    as possible.
    \item Create a CI pipeline such that it runs automatically the different tests and checks
    at each commit to make sure that the code is always working.
    \item Add an easy way for users to create programs and load them into the ROM memory.
    \item Document everything such that users can easily understand how things work and can 
    work on it easily.
\end{enumerate}
