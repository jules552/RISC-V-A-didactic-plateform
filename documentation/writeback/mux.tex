The mux is a small module that is used to select between the three inputs that it has. In this case, it is used to select
between the Branch Unit, the ALU, and the LSU result and then write it back to the register file. \\

Signals:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbullet}]
    \item Input: $alu\_out$, This signal is representing the output of the ALU.
    \item Input: $lsu\_out$, This signal is representing the output of the LSU.
    \item Input: $pc\_plus4$, This signal is representing the output of the Branch Unit.
    \item Input: $data\_dest$, This signal is representing the select signal of the mux.
    \item Output: $wb\_data$, This signal is representing the data that will be written back to the register file.
\end{enumerate}
