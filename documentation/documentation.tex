\section{Introduction}
This document describes the RV32IM processor and its architecture. I've tried to make it as clear 
as possible such that everyone with a basic knowledge of computer architecture can understand it.
It will describe each significant module of the processor, what it does and what are the different
inputs and outputs with an image of the module.
It is recommended to follow this document with the source code of the processor, which is available
in the Verilog folder of the project.
Don't hesitate to use the table of contents to navigate through the different parts of the document.
If you see any mistake or are confused by something don't hesitate to contact me at the mail address
