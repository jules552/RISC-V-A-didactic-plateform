All the different constants were used in the project such that the different values linked to the different operators for 
the LSU, BRU and ALU. It is not an ideal solution but since Verilog doesn't have a better way to share 
constants by for example doing enums, I decided to do it this way. So all the constants are in the parameters.vh file inside 
the Verilog directory.
