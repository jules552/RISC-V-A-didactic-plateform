Running and creating new tests is pretty easy to do, normally if you create new verilog files in the Verilog folder or new tests in
tb folder, it will automatically add it to the compiling process. But how to run the tests? \\

You have to simply install iverilog first using the command on Ubuntu or any Debian based distribution:
\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install iverilog -y
\end{verbatim}

Then goes to the tb folder and run the command:
\begin{verbatim}
    make
\end{verbatim}

It should output the result in the terminal and provide you with a .vcd file that you can open with gtkwave to see the waveform. 
Of course in the case of you added new tests, you have to add the fact of creating the .vcd file in the testbench file. \\
