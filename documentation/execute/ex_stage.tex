The EX stage is the third stage of the pipeline. It is responsible for executing the instruction and forwarding the data to the next stage.
It has two main modules inside of it, the ALU and the Branch Unit. The ALU is responsible for executing the arithmetic and logic operations
and the Branch Unit is responsible for computing the next PC.
